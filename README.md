# Spatio-Temporal Model of Combining ADT and Chemotherapy with Senolytic Treatment in Metastatic Prostate Cancer

Prostate cancer cell depend on androgen for their survival. A standard treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) is androgen deprivation treatment (ADT). However, after a period of remission, some cancer cells changed into androgen-independent cells, and then treatment proceeds with a combination of ADT and chemotherapy. Senescent cells are cells that stop dividing but sustain viability. Senescence cancer cells are common in cancer, and they affect cancer treatment negatively by secreting inflammatory cytokines and pro-cancer VEGF. In this paper, we include the effect of senescence in a model of mPC. We consider combinations of ADT, chemotherapy, and senolytic drug, which eliminate senescent cells, in a spatio-temporal partial differential equations model, and demonstrate that simulations of the model are in agreement with experimental results. We then show how the model can be used to compare tumor volume growth reduction under different protocols of the combined therapy in order to determine the optimal treatment protocol.
